## Violent Python Programming Class

This repository contains coursework from my second Python programming class, which built on foundational Python skills and introduced more advanced programming concepts, practical projects, and security-focused applications. The class emphasized writing efficient, practical scripts for real-world problem solving.


## üìÇ Repository Structure

Assignment1‚ÄìAssignment16/ ‚Äì Progressive exercises covering a wide range of Python topics

Final/ ‚Äì Capstone assignment demonstrating accumulated knowledge

Projects/ ‚Äì small, more applied programs developed outside of core assignments


## üõ†Ô∏è Skills & Concepts Practiced

Advanced Python programming and scripting

File handling, parsing, and data manipulation

Network programming and socket-based communication

Regular expressions and text processing

Web requests, APIs, and automation techniques

Security-related scripting (e.g., password auditing, scanning, or parsing logs)

Object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and design patterns

Error handling, debugging, and code optimization


## üìñ Notes

Assignments 1‚Äì16 progressively increase in complexity, starting from scripting basics and moving toward more advanced programming and security-related tasks.

The Final Project applies multiple concepts in a single, larger script.

The Projects folder contains additional independent programs written during the class for practice and experimentation.


## üéØ Lessons Learned

This class provided deeper exposure to Python programming in a security context, strengthening not just coding proficiency but also the ability to write practical tools for solving real-world technical problems. It significantly expanded my ability to approach cybersecurity and automation tasks with Python.
