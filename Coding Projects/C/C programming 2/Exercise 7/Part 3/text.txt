Write a program that accepts the name of a file as the one and only command line parameter.
The program should read the data from the file, push each character from the file onto a stack
(one by one), pop the characters from the stack, and display them on the console. The
characters should appear on the screen in reverse order from their order in the source text file.
The program must implement a push() function that pushes a character onto the stack and a
pop() function that removes a character from the stack(). Note that you may limit your stack
size to something like 100 characters. This allows you to use an array to manage the stack if
you choose to. When complete, turn in your program using the filename Exercise7_3.c.
