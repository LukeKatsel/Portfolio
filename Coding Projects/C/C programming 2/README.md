## C Programming II

This repository contains coursework from my second C programming class, where I advanced beyond the fundamentals learned in C Programming I. The focus of this course was on building more complex programs using modular design, dynamic memory, and data structures.


## ðŸ“‚ Structure

**Exercise 1 â€“ Exercise 13**
A series of progressively challenging programming exercises covering topics such as:

File I/O operations

Advanced use of pointers

Dynamic memory allocation (malloc/free)

Recursion and iterative problem solving

Data structures such as arrays, structs, and linked lists

Modular design with multiple source and header files

**Final**
A comprehensive final project that applied the semesterâ€™s concepts in a larger program, demonstrating the ability to design, implement, and debug a complete C application.


## Academic Integrity Notice
If you are a student who found this repo while searching for help on coursework:
- **Do not copy** this work into your assignments. 
- Use these examples only as references to learn concepts.
- The best way to grow as a programmer is to solve problems yourself.
- If you need help, feel free to reach out - I'd be glad to offer guidance.
