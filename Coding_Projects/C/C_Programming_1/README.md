# C Programming Projects ‚Äì ECE 175

This repository contains my programming projects from ECE 175: Computer Programming for Engineering Applications. It includes all labs, homework assignments, and my final solo project. These projects were completed using C programming and demonstrate my early foundation in problem-solving, modular programming, and software design.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

**Labs/**
Contains weekly lab assignments covering fundamental C programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, arrays, pointers, and functions.

**Homework/**
Programming assignments that apply course concepts to solve structured problems.

**Final/**
My final solo project for the course: Two Pairs or Better, a simplified poker-style card game written in C.


## üéÆ Final Project ‚Äì Two Pairs or Better

The final project was to design and implement a card game simulator where the player bets coins, is dealt a 5-card hand, and can choose which cards to keep or discard. The goal is to achieve two pairs or better for a payout.

**Game Features**

- Deck of 52 cards implemented as a linked list
- Shuffling and dealing functions
- Player hand stored as a linked list
- Functionality to discard and replace cards
- Hand evaluation system for poker rankings
- Betting and payout system

**Poker Hand Rankings**

From highest to lowest:

Royal Flush (250√ó bet)
Straight Flush (100√ó bet)
Four of a Kind (50√ó bet)
Full House (25√ó bet)
Flush (10√ó bet)
Straight (5√ó bet)
Three of a Kind (4√ó bet)
Two Pairs (2√ó bet)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Concepts

- Language: C
- Data Structures: Linked Lists
- Concepts: Modular programming, function prototypes, input/output handling,    randomization, and game logic

## üìñ Notes

- These projects represent my first experience programming in C.
- The final project was a solo effort that strengthened my understanding of linked lists, modular code design, and problem-solving.


## Academic Integrity Notice
If you are a student who found this repo while searching for help on coursework:
- **Do not copy** this work into your assignments. 
- Use these examples only as references to learn concepts.
- The best way to grow as a programmer is to solve problems yourself.
- If you need help, feel free to reach out - I'd be glad to offer guidance.
