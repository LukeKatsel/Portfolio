## x86 Assembly Programming Class

This repository contains projects and exercises from my first x86 Assembly programming class. The programs are primarily written and structured as Visual Studio projects, reflecting the development environment used during the course.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

Exercise 1/ ‚Äì Introduction to assembly syntax, registers, and basic operations

Exercise 2/ ‚Äì Working with loops, conditions, and memory addressing

Exercise 3/ ‚Äì Procedures, stack usage, and program structure

Final/ ‚Äì Capstone project applying the key concepts from the class

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills & Concepts Practiced

Understanding CPU architecture and instruction execution

Working with registers, memory, and the stack

Control flow with conditional jumps and loops

Implementing procedures and parameter passing

Debugging and analyzing assembly code in Visual Studio

## üìñ Notes

- Most programs are structured as Visual Studio projects, so files include solution/project files alongside the .asm source code.
- The Final Project demonstrates combining multiple concepts learned throughout the class.
