## Python Programming Class Projects

This repository contains assignments from my first Python programming class, along with a set of V2 versions that I completed later as a refresher. The original assignments represent my initial progress learning Python, while the V2 versions show how I approached the same problems again with more experience and perspective.

Final Project/ ‚Äì The capstone assignment for the class

Each assignment folder contains:

- The original version (from the class)

- A V2 version (completed later as a refresher)

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The Final Project does not have a V2
    

 ## üõ†Ô∏è Skills & Concepts Practiced

Python fundamentals (variables, data types, loops, conditionals)

Functions and modular programming

File I/O and basic data handling

Error handling and debugging

Object-oriented programming (OOP) basics

Problem-solving and code refactoring

## üìñ Notes

The V2 versions are not rewrites but re-approaches. They follow the same assignment goals, but you‚Äôll notice differences in structure, style, and logic reflecting my growth as a programmer.

The Final Project was left as-is to preserve the original capstone work.
