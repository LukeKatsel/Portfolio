# Luke's Technical Portfolio
This is a standard portfolio where I showcase my projects and document my learning journey.

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio - a central hub for my projects in:
- Cybersecurity (SOC HomeLab, detection engineering, adversary emulation)
- Software Development (Python, C, Assembly)
- Systems and Networking


## ðŸ›¡ Cybersecurity 
 **SOC HomeLab** (./HomeLab-SOC)
 - A self-built SOC environment for network monitoring, intrusion detection, and incident response using pfSense, Security Onion, Zeek, and Suricata. 


 **IoT Camera Research Project** (./IoT Camera Research Project)
 - Performed a penetration test on a an IoT camera to identify and exploit security vulnerabilities, demonstrating real-world device risks. 

 **Simulated Water Company Pen-Test** (./Simulated Water Company Pen-Test)
 - Performed a full penetration test on a simulated industrial control system, identifying vulnerabilities and securing HMI controls to prevent a critical flood scenario.

## ðŸ“„ Licensing and Attribution 

 This portfolio contains projects created during my coursework and personal study.
 Projects fall into three categories: 

 1. **Original Work**
    Written entirely by me, sometimes based on requirement or guidelines from coursework.
    These projects are licensed under the MIT License.

 2. **Mixed Contribution**
    Primarily written by me, but starting code or templated were provided by my professor.
    In such cases, attribution is included where possible in the projects README or comments. 

 3. **Commentary on Provided Code**
    Code supplied entirely by my professor, to which I added detailed line-by-line commentary.
    These projects are shared for educational demonstration only and are **not licensed** for redistribution. 

 If you have questions about the authorship or licensing of a specific project, please refer to its individual README or contact me directly.  


 ## Academic Integrity Notice
 If you are a student who found this repo while searching for help on coursework:
 - **Do not copy** this work into your assignments. 
 - Use these examples only as references to learn concepts.
 - The best way to grow as a programmer is to solve problems yourself.
 - If you need help, feel free to reach out - I'd be glad to offer guidance.
